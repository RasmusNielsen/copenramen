	- Eggmaster app recommended [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/eggmaster-a-sophisticated-egg-timer/id750958213?mt=8)
* Cool the eggs with cold water
* Peel and place eggs in a bag with soy sauce and mirin 
* Let them marinate for at least 3-4 hours in the refrigerator
* Cut in half just before ramen is ready.

### 🥩 Chasu

* Cut negi (use the white part)
* Cut ginger
* Sprinkle and rub the salt on the pork belly.
* Heat the oil in a cast iron skillet (or regular frying pan) over high heat and brown the fat side first, then flip over to brown the other side. It’ll take about 10 minutes.
* Add ⅔ cup water, ⅓ cup sake, ⅓ cup soy sauce, ⅓ cup mirin into a pot.
* Place the pork belly in the pot and add ginger and negi and bring it to a boil.
* Stay in the kitchen as the meat can easily get burnt if there is no liquid left. After 15-20 minutes or so, bubbles start to appear. You are getting close to the end. Turn off the heat when you see the bottom of the pot when you slide the meat around. The sauce is now thickened and meat is shiny.
* Take out the meat and cut into thin slices.
* This is an optional step, but use a propane torch or broiler to sear each slice of pork belly to enhance the flavor.

### 🐓 Make chicken stock
* Cut garlic, onion and ginger into fine slices
* Add sesame oil to a pan
* Fry garlic, onion and ginger slighty.
* Add water to 
* Add chicken/veggie boullion.

### 🥘 Miso

* Add misopaste to the chicken stock
* Add Chilipaste
* Add Chili oil (La-Yu) to taste.
* Add Chili flakes (Shichimi)

### 🥄 Mix

* Serve with meat, negi and sesame as shown on image.
